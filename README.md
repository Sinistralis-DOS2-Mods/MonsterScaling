Ascension for Divinity: Original Sin 2
=======
Ascension is a mod that aims to overhaul Divinity Original Sin 2's progression with the goal of injecting far more build diversity and player choice into the game through worthwhile abilities, talents, and item options with the hope of being able to deliver a challenging experience in both the base game, and future content additions, to put that expanded player choice to the test.

### Usage
This mod is on github both for my own sanity and as a learning tool. I do some hacky things to make certain ideas work, and having a place to look that stuff up can prove useful I feel. Additionally, I learn best through example, so feel free to dig through any of my changes and learn or critique.

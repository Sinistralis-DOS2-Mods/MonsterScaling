Monster Scaling for Divinity: Original Sin 2
=======
Levels monsters up to your level upon entering combat. It's as simple as that. This should not conflict with any mod and is compatible with any kind of mod that alters enemy scaling.

It does not scale enemies down to your level.

### Usage
This is a very simple mod that can be used for learning purposes. I also use this incase the editor freaks out and deletes everything, which has been known to happen.
